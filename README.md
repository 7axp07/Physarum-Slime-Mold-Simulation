Entirely own work, made as a final grade project in high school.
Should work on IntelliJ if all libraries are installed. Runs on Java 10.

Visual simulation inspired by the Physarum slime mold, made using Java and JavaFX.
Has adjustable parameters to display all sorts of outcomes:
- number of particles
- color(+ color-changing mode*)
- particle trail decay
- diffusion rate (impacts the movement of the particles)
- individual particles' vision range

* Color-changing mode may be hard on people with epilepsy!
