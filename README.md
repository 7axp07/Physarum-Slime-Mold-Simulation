Visual simulation inspired by the Physarum slime mold, made using Java and JavaFX.
Has adjustable parameters to display all sorts of outcomes:
- number of particles
- color(+ color-changing mode!)
- particle trail decay
- diffusion rate (impacts the movement of the particles)
- individual particles' vision range

Color-changing mode may be hard on people with epilepsy!
